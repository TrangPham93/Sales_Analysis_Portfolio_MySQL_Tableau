## Data cleaning

```sql
/*
Importing excel file to Workbench, however, the Order_Date and Shipping_Date are not correctly imported as date type.
 
1. Add column order_date_modified
2. Change Order_date from String type to Date type and add to new Order_date_modified column
3. Drop column order_date, change the name of new order_date_modified to replace the original order_date.

*/

alter table sales_non_eu.orders
add column order_date_modified date;

### Top selling products in each category

```sql
with RankedProducts as
(SELECT 
    p.Category,
    p.Product_Name, 
    SUM(o.Quantity) AS sold_quantity,
    RANK() over (partition by p.category order by sum(o.quantity) desc ) as product_rank
    
FROM
    sales_non_eu.orders o
        JOIN
    sales_non_eu.products p ON o.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
        JOIN
    sales_non_eu.customers c ON o.Customer_ID = c.Customer_ID
GROUP BY 1,2
order by sold_quantity desc)
SELECT 
    Category,
    Product_Name,
    sold_quantity
FROM
    RankedProducts
WHERE
    product_rank = 1
;

```

â‡› These products are best sellers in each categories, with staple paper of the higest sold quantity.

### Distribution of customers by country

```sql
SELECT 
    Country,
    ROUND(AVG(score)) AS Average_score,
    COUNT(*) AS Customer_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT 
                    COUNT(*)
                FROM
                    sales_non_eu.customers) * 100) AS Percentage
FROM
    sales_non_eu.customers
GROUP BY Country 
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
;
```


|Country    | Average_score| Customer_count | Customer_count|
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
|USA	    |42	           |254	            |32             |
|France	    |47	           |246	            |31             |
|Germany	|48	           |241             |30             |
|Italy	    |53	           |59	            |7              |


â‡› Germany, US and France have equal proportion of the total number of customers, while Italy only has 7% of total number of customers. 

### Distribution of customers by score

```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(score), MAX(Score)
FROM
    sales_non_eu.customers;

```

|MIN(score)	|MAX(Score)|
|-----------|----------|
|0	        |100       |

â‡› Min value of score is 0 and max value is 100, so the range can be divided into 5 bins. 

```sql

    
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN score < 20 THEN ' under 20'
        WHEN score BETWEEN 20 AND 39 THEN '20-39'
        WHEN score BETWEEN 40 AND 59 THEN '40-59'
        WHEN score BETWEEN 60 AND 79 THEN '60-79'
        ELSE '80 and above'
    END AS score_group,
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count,
    concat(round(count(*)/(select count(*) from sales_non_eu.customers)*100),'%') customers_percentage
FROM
    sales_non_eu.customers
GROUP BY score_group
order by score_group
;
```



|score_group    | customer_count| customers_percentage | 
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
|under 20       |205            |26%                   |

# Insight

After reviewing the sales data, it's obvious that Germany, US and France are main markets while Italian market is relatively small in term of sales and profit. Italian market has the potential to increase sales and profit in the future, since it also generate high profit margin. 

Furniture generates highest sales, but is not automatically the most profitable category. On the contrary, furniture is the least profitable, in which table has generated loss in all markets. Table's sales has increased significantly from previous year, which is not great in this case. Increasing table's retail price or reducing this product's proportion in total sales would help to limit table's negative impact on the bottom line. 

We should carefully observing bookcase's sales and profit, which is potentially similar to table's situation.
